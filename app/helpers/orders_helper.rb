            # The render function will then look for `views/people/_address_fields.html.erb`
            # The render function also needs to be passed the value of 'builder', because `views/people/_address_fields.html.erb` needs this to render the form tags.
            render(association.to_s.singularize + "_fields", f: builder)

        # This renders a simple link, but passes information into `data` attributes.
            # This info can be named anything we want, but in this case we chose `data-id:` and `data-fields:`.
        # The `id:` is from `new_object.object_id`.
        # The `fields:` are rendered from the `fields` blocks.
            # We use `gsub("\n", "")` to remove anywhite space from the rendered partial.
        # The `id:` value needs to match the value used in `child_index: id`.
